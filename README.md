- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ventu01
- 👀 I am interested in cybersecurity, Kali Linux, Kodachi Linux, Blockchain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Blockchain use and the way it work (I had studied IT at secondary school so I have a base where to start from) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain projects, and when I learn the cybersecurity I will collaborate on it.
      I am currently looking for someone willing to teach me the basics of Linux or someone to pass me some documentation to use to learn Linux, especially KALI and Kodachi Linux.
- 📫 You can find me at marcoventurini30@gmail.com
